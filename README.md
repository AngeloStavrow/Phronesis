1. Priorities are the things that you sacrifice everything for. If you’re struggling to decide, it’s not a priority.
2. The ability to endure discomfort is a muscle. The more you do it, the better you get at it.
3. You should probably have a drink of water.
4. You can choose how you show up for a relationship. Every such choice confirms who you strive to be.
5. Goals are good. Standards are better.
6. “One size fits all” rarely does.
